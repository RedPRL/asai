{1 What is "asai"?}

"asai" is the transliteration of "æµ…äº•", the family name of the character Kei Asai (æµ…äº• ã‚±ã‚¤) in the Japanese light novel Sagrada Reset (ã‚µã‚¯ãƒ©ãƒ€ãƒªã‚»ãƒƒãƒˆ, also known in English as Sakurada Reset). His ability is perfect photographic memory that is even immune to the "Reset" ability owned by another main character. This OCaml library should record all messages, just like the character.
