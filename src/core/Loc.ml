(* [NOTE: Codepoints, Codeunits, and Grapheme Clusters]
   In general, when doing any sort of user-facing display of things
   like column numbers, we want to count (Extended) Grapheme Clusters
   as defined in UAX#29. These are what we could best call a single "character",
   at least for the purposes of text display. As an example, the "character"
   'aÌˆ' really consists of 2 codepoints: one for the letter 'a', and another
   for the diacritic.

   This may make it seem like we want to use grapheme clusters everywhere in
   our span, but this isn't feasible for 2 reasons.
   1. Slicing becomes an O(n) operation, as we need to perform cluster
      counting during the slice.
   2. As a more practical matter, none of the OCaml lexers return cluster
      counts for spans, instead returning raw byte indicies (ocamllex),
      or codepoint indicies (sedlex).

   Codepoint indexing is also out, as slicing/indexing are O(n) operations,
   which is a total dealbreaker.

   Instead, we measure everything in bytes (or, in fancier terms, UTF-8 codeunits).
   This gives us O(1) indexing + slicing, which is really what we wanted all along.
