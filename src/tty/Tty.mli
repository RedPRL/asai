(** This module provides functions to display or interact with diagnostics in UNIX terminals. A message will look like this:

    {v
    ü≠Å examples/stlc/example.lambda
    ‚îÇ
  1 ‚îÇ (check (Œª √§ (Œª 123
  2 ‚îÇ   sdaf)) (‚Üí ‚Ñï (‚Üí ‚Ñï ‚Ñï)))
    ‚îä
 20 ‚îÇ ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 21 ‚îÇ noooooooooooooooooo
    ‚î∑
 [E002] Why am I checking the term (‚Üí ‚Ñï (‚Üí ‚Ñï ‚Ñï)),
        which looks amazing?

  (** [display d] prints the diagnostic [d] to the standard output, using terminal control characters for formatting. A message will look like this:

      @param show_backtrace Whether the backtrace should be shown. The default is [false].
      @param line_breaking The algorithm to recognize (hard) line breaks. The [`Unicode] algorithm recognizes all Unicode character sequences in {{:https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/ch05.pdf#G41643}Unicode 15.0.0 Table 5-1} as line breaks. The [`Traditional] algorithm only recognizes [U+000A (LF)], [U+000D (CR)], and [U+000D U+000A (CRLF)] as line breaks. The default is the [`Traditional] algorithm.
      @param block_splitting_threshold The maximum number of consecutive, non-highlighted lines allowed in a block. The function will try to minimize the number of blocks, as long as no block has too many consecutive, non-highlighted lines. A higher threshold will lead to fewer blocks. When the threshold is zero, it means no block can contain any non-highlighted line. The default value is zero.
      @param tab_size The number of spaces that should be used to replace a horizontal tab. Note that a horizontal tab is always expanded to the same number of spaces. The result should still be visually appealing as long as horizontal tabs are only used at the beginning of lines. The default value is [8].

      @raise Invalid_argument if `tab_size < 0`.
